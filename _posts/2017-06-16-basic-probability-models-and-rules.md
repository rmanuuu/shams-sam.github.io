* Trail or Experiment - The act that leads to a result with certain possibility.
* Sample Space	- Set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
* Event -	Non empty subset of a sample space.

* Basic probability formula:
\\[P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(E_i)\\]
<dl>
Where 
<dd>A is an event,</dd>
<dd>S is the sample space,</dd>
<dd>\\(E_1 ... E_n\\) are the n outcomes in A.</dd>
<\dl>

* if \\(E_1 ... E_n\\) are equally likely, then
\\[P(A) = \frac{Number of outcomes in A}{Number of outcomes in S}\\]
<dl>
Hence
<dd>\\(0 \leq P(A) \leq 1\\),</dd>
<dd>\\(P(S) = 1\\)</dd>
<\dl>
