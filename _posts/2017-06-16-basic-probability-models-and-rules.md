* Trail or Experiment - The act that leads to a result with certain possibility.
* Sample Space	- Set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
* Event -	Non empty subset of a sample space.

* Basic probability formula: if A is an event of an experiment and it contains n outcomes and S is the sample space then,
\\[P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(E_i)\\]
where \\(E_1 ... E_n\\) are outcomes in A.
